cert google
======================================

# Create a certificate directory
mkdir ~/.certs

# Create a new database in the certs dir (dont forget to enter your pass phrase!)
certutil -N -d ~/.certs 

# Create three files for the cert chain
touch ~/.certs/google ~/.certs/geotrust ~/.certs/equifax

# Copy the cert chain for smtp.google.com:465 over to my_certs file (don't forget the -showcerts option, CTRL + C to end this command)
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect smtp.gmail.com:465 > ~/.certs/my_certs


=============================


# Open your my_certs file you made earlier and copy the google cert (usually the first one)
nano ~/.certs/my_certs

# Open your google file, paste the google cert that you just copied, and save and close
nano ~/.certs/google

# Open your my_certs file you made earlier and copy the geotrust cert (usually the second one)
nano ~/.certs/my_certs

# Open your geotrust file, paste the geotrust cert that you just copied, and save and close
nano ~/.certs/geotrust

# Open your my_certs file you made earlier and copy the equifax cert (usually the third one)
nano ~/.certs/my_certs

# Open your equifax file, paste the equifax cert that you just copied, and save and close
nano ~/.certs/equifax

========================================

Now we have to import each of these certs into the db.

# Import the google cert into the db
certutil -A -n "Google Internet Authority" -t "TC,," -d ~/.certs -i ~/.certs/google

# Import the geotrust cert into the db
certutil -A -n "GeoTrust Global CA" -t "TC,," -d ~/.certs -i ~/.certs/geotrust

# Import the equifax cert into the db
certutil -A -n "Equifax Secure Certificate Authority" -t "TCP,," -d ~/.certs -i ~/.certs/equifax

# Double check to make sure everything imported correctly into the db
certutil -L -d ~/.certs
